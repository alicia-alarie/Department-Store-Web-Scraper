    items?

    * What influences price of a clothing item the most- material, gender, or brand?

    * What proportion of the inventory is for plus, petite, and regular sizes? Does this reflect 
    the demand and demographics of the population?

    * What proportion of the clothing inventory is menswear vs womenswear?

    * Are most brands exclusively menswear or womenswear?
